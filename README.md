# train_wifi

I take a train to go to work everyday. The train is in Taraval st, San Francisco, and the street is full of houses with comcast router. This script continuously check for the closer xfinitywifi hotspot and attempt to connect to it.

You may use this to connect to a distributed hotspot while driving a car or something in your city.
